To do a build you will need to set up autoconf first:

	aclocal
	autoheader
	automake --add-missing
	autoconf

If all goes well you should see a file named "configure" in
the top directory. Do the following to build and install:

	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

This will install the package under the default top level directory,
"/usr/local", where the executables are under "/usr/local/bin" and
documentations are under "/usr/local/share/doc", etc. If you rather 
install the package under a different existing directory, for example 
"/home/db3w", add the "-prefix=" option to configure:

	./configure -prefix=/home/db3w
	
If you already have write permissions to this directory then the install
does not need to be done with "sudo". However, to view the man pages for 
the executables, "hbdbe", "hbcmd", "hbhlp" and "db3w.cgi" you will need
to add the following line to "/etc/man_db.conf":

	MANPATH_MAP     /home/db3w/bin          /home/db3w/share/man

***********************************************************************

After the install is finished, there are 2 additional tarballs which are 
part of the install and need to be extracted to make the installation 
complete:

1. Go to "$prefix$/share/doc/db3w" and untar the file "hbdocs.tgz",
   where $prefix$ is the top level install directory. This will install 
   the documentation for "hbcmd" and "hbapi" in this directory (you may 
   need to use "sudo" for this if you took the default and do not have
   write permission to "/usr/local");

2. Untar the file "$prefix$/share/examples/db3w/db3w.examples.tgz" to your 
   home directory. This will create a db3w subdirctory containing all 
   the example database and procedure files.

Assuming "$prefix$/bin" is in your PATH, at the bash "$" prompt simply do:

	$ hbdbe

This starts the database server, HB*Engine, in User Mode (running as you,
the login user) where it only servers clients running as the same user 
as the server. The command line client, HB*Commander, is started by typing:

	$ hbcmd

You can run this in any directory but once it starts, it will set the 
Default Path to your home directory. After the Sign-on messages, you should 
be at HB*Commander's "1>" prompt, waiting for a command (The "1" stands for 
"Table Context #1".) Note that in this instance, the server and client are 
both running on the same host and as the same user.

The directory which contains the example database files is "db3w/dbase" under
your home directory. At the "1>" prompt, type:

	1>cd db3w/dbase
	1>dir

You should see a listing of the files in that directory. There should be a 
database table file named "company.tbl" in that list. Try:

	1>use company
	company>display structure

If you see a table structure displayed, you are ready to enter additional 
commands to explore HB*Engine's functionalities. To see a list of commands, 
do:

	1>help commands

To see a list of functions, do:

	1>help functions

To see the documentation on a keyword, such as the command "USE", do:

	1>help use

Note that the help files extracted in the addtional installation step above 
with file extention ".hlp" are located under "$prefix$/share/doc/db3w"
and the ones under "hbcmd" can be viewed with the "HELP" command while  
HB*Commander is running. The ones under "hbapi" are viewd with the "hbhlp" 
tool at the bash prompt. For example:

	$ hbhlp hbapi/dbe_init_session
	
This will display the documentation for the HBAPI call "dbe_init_session()".

******************************************************************************

To get "db3w.cgi" running you must set up the HTTP server as documented in
db3w.cgi(8), which can be viewed, after doing the build and install, with the
"man" command:

	man db3w.cgi

Essentially the HTTP server, "httpd", must be configured to run as the login
user (for the purpose of testing the examples) which is the same user "hbdbe"
is running as. The site config file must be set up with ScriptAlias 
"/cgi-bin/" pointing to "$prefix$/bin/" where "db3w.cgi" resides. Once 
everything is set up and "httpd" is successfully started, simply point your 
browser to the server's IP address and you should see "index.html" displayed 
which has 2 links on it. The first starts a table browse demo and the 2nd 
starts a registration demo.

*******************************************************************************

To run the database server, "hbdbe", in Administrator Mode, you must start
"hbdbe" as root and designate a user as the Administrator. For example:

	hbdbe -user db3w
	
Where "db3w" exists as a user on the server host OS and will be the
Administrator for the users, or apps, created by the User Administration
app. Additional documentation can be viewed with the "man" command:

	man hbdbe
